Ask yourself this: interrogative is your_name?
For some, it may be a collection of noun1 written in language for their class_level project class.
For others, it may be the adjective1 family_member who's in jail for crime.
For God, it is His adjective2 traitor, a fallen noun2, whose noun3 are to be verb1 to dust.
Our development team hopes to verb2 the little knowledge we have on  your_name's existence, to the tune of adjective3 gameplay, a working noun4, and much more! However, we are on a strict timer.
Come month year, your_name's powers will be out of our body part.
We must do what we can, individually and as a team, to solve the mystery: interrogative is your_name?
