Tonight's the 'adjective' night:
my first 'action' performance! 
I've been 'active verb' very hard for this, and I hope my 'noun' will pay off. 
The performance is at 'number' o' clock tonight, and 'plural noun' are $10. 
I'm a little 'adjective', but I'm 'adjective' too! 
I hope that you 'verb' my 'noun' tonight!
