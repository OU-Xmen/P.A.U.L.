Tonight is the adjective1 office holiday party, and I do hereby promise that I will not make the same adjective2 mistake as I did last year. I will not verb too much beverage and fall on my bodypart1. When my boss wishes me a happy/merry holiday, I will not shout, "derogatory_saying" I will not sniff near my boss's wife and ask her why she's marinating in such a/an adjective3 perfume. I will not make photocopies of my bodypart2 or step in the food. I understand that it does not amuse my colleagues when I joke, "This isn't an office, it's a/an place with flourescent lighting! This year I promise to be on my most adjective4 behavior, because it would be unfortunate to look for another job for the number holiday in a row...
