# P.A.U.L.
Ask yourself this: What is P.A.U.L.? For some, it may be a collection of games written in Python for their sophomore project class. For others, it may be the weird uncle who's in jail for tax fraud. For God, it is His worst traitor, a fallen angel, whose wings are to be crushed to dust. Our development team hopes to offer the little knowledge we have on P.A.U.L.'s existence, to the tune of exciting gameplay, a working leaderboard, and much more! However, we are on a strict timer. Come May 2023, P.A.U.L.'s powers will be out of our hands. We must do what we can, individually and as a team, to solve the mystery: What is P.A.U.L.?

Requires: Python 3.10+
